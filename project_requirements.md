## REQUIREMENTS

[x] Use the Ruby on Rails framework.

[x] Your models must include a has_many, a belongs_to, and a has_many :through relationship. You can include more models to fill out your domain, but there must be at least a model acting as a join table for the has_many through. Also, make sure that the join table contains at least one user submittable attribute; for example: rides with tickets or appointments with times.

[ ] Your models should include reasonable validations for the simple attributes. You don't need to add every possible validation or duplicates, such as presence and a minimum length, but the models should defend against invalid data.

[x] You must include at least one class level ActiveRecord scope methods. To some extent these class scopes can be added to power a specific individual feature, such as "My Overdue Tasks" in a TODO application, scoping all tasks for the user by a datetime scope for overdue items, @user.tasks.overdue. Reports make for a good usage of class scopes, such as "Most Valuable Cart by Customer" where the code would implement a Cart.most_valuable and Cart.by_customer which could be combined as Cart.most_valuable.by_customer(@customer).

[x] Your application must provide a standard user authentication, including signup, login, logout, and passwords. You can use Devise but given the complexity of that system, you should also feel free to roll your own authentication logic.

[ ] Your authentication system should allow login from some other service. Facebook, twitter, foursquare, github, etc...

[ ] You must make use of a nested resource with the appropriate RESTful URLs. Additionally, your nested resource must provide a form that relates to the parent resource. Imagine an application with user profiles. You might represent a person's profile via the RESTful URL of /profiles/1, where 1 is the primary key of the profile. If the person wanted to add pictures to their profile, you could represent that as a nested resource of /profiles/1/pictures, listing all pictures belonging to profile 1. The route /profiles/1/pictures/new would allow me to upload a new picture to profile 1. Focus on making a working application first and then adding more complexity. Making a nested URL resource like '/divisions/:id/teams/new' is great. Having a complex nested resource like 'countries/:id/sports/:id/divisions/:id/teams/new' is going to make this much harder on you.

[ ] Your forms should correctly display validation errors. Your fields should be enclosed within a fields_with_errors class and error messages describing the validation failures must be present within the view.

[x] Your application must be, within reason, a DRY (Do-Not-Repeat-Yourself) rails app. Logic present in your controllers should be encapsulated as methods in your models. Your views should use helper methods and partials to be as logic-less as possible. Follow patterns in the Rails Style Guide and the Ruby Style Guide.

[x] Do not use scaffolding to build your project. Your goal here is to learn. Scaffold is a way to get up and running quickly, but learning a lot is not one of the benefits of scaffolding. That’s why we do not allow the use of scaffolding for projects.

## INSTRUCTIONS

[x] Create a new repository on GitHub for your Rails application.

[x] When you create the Rails app for your assessment, add the spec.md file from this repo to the root directory of the project, commit it to Git and push it up to GitHub.

[x] Build your application. Make sure to commit early and commit often. Commit messages should be meaningful (clearly describe what you're doing in the commit) and accurate (there should be nothing in the commit that doesn't match the description in the commit message). Good rule of thumb is to commit every 3-7 mins of actual coding time. Most of your commits should have under 15 lines of code and a 2 line commit is perfectly acceptable. This is important and you'll be graded on this.

[x] Record at least a 30 min coding session. During the session, either think out loud or not. It's up to you. You don't need to submit it, but we may ask for it at a later time.

[ ] Make sure to check each box in your spec.md (replace the space between the square braces with an x) and explain next to each one how you've met the requirement before you submit your project.

[x] Write a README.md.

[ ] Fill out this checklist. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QlU2-UQNSjlv2Tf2yP8oDsduMobK_1w0ZFXaTpywMCk/viewform?edit_requested=true

[ ] Submit a video of how a user would interact with your working web application.

[x] Write a blog post about the project and process.

[ ] When done, submit your GitHub repo's url, a link to your video demo, and a link to your blog post in the corresponding text boxes in the right rail. Hit "I'm done" to wrap it up.
